# DungeonGame
Text-based game where players can choose between different paths leading to different randomly-selected events leading to different endings. Each playthrough is unique; the same player on different playthroughs could have very different experiences, ranging from defeating every monster until escaping the dungeon to smooth-talking a skeleton into a bar date.
